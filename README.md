It is important to read and install the requirements to be able to run the AI.

In this project, I worked on transforming visual data into machine-understandable language using image captioning AI.

Images, although rich in untapped information, often go unnoticed by search engines and data systems. Transforming this visual data into machine-readable language is a complex task, but this is where image captioning AI comes in handy. This technology improves accessibility by helping visually impaired people understand visual content. It also improves SEO by assisting search engines in identifying image content, facilitates content discovery through efficient analysis and categorization of large image databases, and supports social media and advertising by generating engaging descriptions. automatically. Additionally, it improves safety by providing real-time descriptions of activities in video recordings, and assists in education and research by helping to understand and interpret visual materials. It also offers multilingual support by generating subtitles in multiple languages ​​for international audiences, organizes data by helping to manage and categorize large sets of visual data, saves time by being more efficient than manual efforts, and increases user engagement by making visual content more attractive and informative.

At the end of this project, I managed to implement an image captioning tool using Hugging Face's Transformers BLIP model, use Gradio to provide a user-friendly interface in the image captioning application, and adapt the tool to real business scenarios, demonstrating its practical applications.
